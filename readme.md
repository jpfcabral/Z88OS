# Compile in linux environments

Flags for profiling was added to makefile, just run in terminal:

`make`

Then you can see the compiled file in `bin/unix64/z88r`

To execute profiling analysis, run inside folder with related mesh files:

`./z88r -c -siccg`

Then:

`gprof ./z88r | gprof2dot | dot -Tpng -o output.png`
